*** GIFTASTIC ***

*** Description ***
GifTastic is a simple app that lets users find GIFs based on their input. Users have the option to choose from a pre-displayed array of emotions and can add their input to the array. GIFs can be animated by clicking on them.

*** Motivation ***
This game is part of the University of Minnesota's Web Application Development program in which students can utilize their newly-found API retrieval abilities.

*** Result ***
The result is quick way for users to search gifs based on their input.

*** Improvements ***
I would like the GIF input to display as their added to the array. The GIFs should also be populating in rows instead of one single column.
