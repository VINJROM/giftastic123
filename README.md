*** GIFTASTIC ***

<!-- What this does -->
GifTastic is a simple app that lets users find GIFs based on their input. Users have the option to choose from a pre-displayed array of emotions and can add their input to the array. GIFs can be animated by clicking on them.

<!-- What's coming -->
I would like the GIF input to display as their added to the array. The GIFs should also be populating in rows instead of one single column.
